			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocoding</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I felt challenged by this lab becuase I did not know whether to try to acytally code 
						in javascript or to just write on a document or what. I talked to my TA Ilia and they
						were able to clear up for me we weren't really do any actual coding, but we were writing down the first steps of that coding
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems I ran into were figuring out how to order the rock paper scissors, like where to put the draw and order of operations
						I talked with my partner to solve the problem! </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was intersting, I think I was really thrown off gaurd becuase I expected the assignment to be more concrete?
						 I felt a little intimiated cause I was worried I was gunna do soemthing wrong, I talked to a couple people in class who seemed also a little confused
						but ultimately I realized it was not as much of a daunting task as i thought</p>
